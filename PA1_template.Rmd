####Loading and preprocessing the data

The data file activity.csv is loaded with no further processing

```{r Data loading and preparation}
setwd("C:/Users/John/git/RepData1") # Set the working directory
unzip("activity.zip") # Unzip the data
activityData <- read.csv("activity.csv") # Load the data into a variable
```

####What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r Histogram and summary of base data Steps per day, fig.height=4,fig.width=4}

hist(as.numeric(tapply(activityData$steps,activityData$date,sum)),main="Steps per day", xlab="Steps per day",breaks=61,col="Red")

summary(tapply(activityData$steps,activityData$date,sum))


```

The data show a mean number of steps of 10770 with a median value of 10760
